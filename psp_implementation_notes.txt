Discretizing model behaviour - possible output patterns

Factors:
Task (A, B) - Word Reading vs. Colour Naming
Switch (0, 1) Repeat vs. Switch 

Stim Valency (V0,V1) - neutral vs. incongruent 
Response Set Overlap (R0,R1) - non-overlapping (response gated) vs. overlapping (not gated)
Stim onset (o0,o1) - synchronous vs. delayed 


Empirical: other possibilities
0 < 1 : 0 = 1, 0 > 1 : Switch Cost -1, 0, 1
A < B : A = B, A > B : Task Difficulty -1, 0, 1
(A,1) - (A,0) > (B,1) - (B,0) : Asymmetric Switch Cost -1, 0, 1




Same effects for neutral and incongruent stimuli, but RTs lower (effects smaller) for neutral


basic effect 	 [1,1,1], (V1,R1,o0) 	 [1,1,1] (V0,R1,o0)  - figure 6
delayed onset 	 [1,1,-1], (V1,R1,o1) 	 [1,1,-1] (V0,R1,o1) - figure 6
response gating  [1,1,-1], (v1,R0,o0) 	 [1,1,-1] (V0,R0,o0) - figure 7







Implementation in the model:
Stim Valency - (1) modification of eqn 1 (input) - input = k(strength + priming) + control + noise, k=0.6 IMPL
               (2) value of F changed from 0.5 to 0. IMPL
	       Neutral stimuli therefore involve changes to input AND response resolution process  
	       CURRENT STATUS: works (ie., produces smaller RTs but same empirical pattern for default, RSO and SOA)

Response Set Overlap - Response Gating - (1) only relevant stimuli enter response resolution IMPL
	 Unclear from the paper how this is achieved. setting generation time to zero?
	 (2) Setting F to zero? (ie, as per Stim valency?) 
	 Current Status: None of (1 & 2), (1) or (2) seems to invert the switch cost asymmetry for 
	 given parameter settings.
	 


Stim Onset - (1) modified control inputs IMPL !WORKS
             (2) add 160 to response generation times for irrelevant stimuli during response resolution process 
	     IMPL, WORKS but with v. high error rate
	     Current status: Works for mean RTs but with v. high error rate.
	     Misprint in paper re. control settings for 160ms delay?     


Implemented the training procedure as it seems essential to get the correct results for the experimental conditions
