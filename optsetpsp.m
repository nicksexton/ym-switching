function options = optsetpsp(varargin)

%OPTIONS = OPTSETPSP('PARAM1',VALUE1,'PARAM2',VALUE2,...) creates a PSP search
%   options structure OPTIONS in which the named parameters have the specified
%   values. Any unspecified parameters are set to [] (parameters with value []
%   indicate to use the default value for that parameter when OPTIONS is passed
%   to PSP). It is sufficient to type only the leading characters that uniquely
%   identify the parameter. Case is ignored for parameter names.
%     
%   OPTSETPSP PARAMETERS:
%
%   MaxPSP - Maximum number of search cycles allowed before termination. 
%   The PSP search stops when the number of search cycles of every Markov chain
%   (in every discovered region) reaches MaxPSP. A cycle consists of a certain
%   number of search trials (i.e., MCMC sample points). The cycle size is set
%   by the 2nd element of SmpSize (see below). The couting of cycles does not
%   begin until the adaptive stage of every Markov chain enters the stage of a
%   regular MCMC sampling. The default value is 6. Setting MaxPSP to a low
%   value may cause an incomplete search or unreliable information on the
%   partition of parameter space.
%   Note: PSP has an internal mechanism that makes the total number of MCMC
%   trials in the search history eventually equalized for all discovred
%   parameter regions. It is due to this mechanism that everytime a new region
%   is identified, the algorithm concentrates for a while on the search
%   near it.
%
%   IniJump - Initial size of jumping distribution with which the Markov chain of
%   a newly found region starts. The jumping distribution of the MCMC process is a
%   uniform density over a hyper-sphere. IniJump specifies the initial size of the
%   sphere's radius. The regular MCMC sampling process in each discovered region
%   does not begin until the size of jumping distribution is adapted so that it
%   meets a certain rate of sample acceptance. IniJump does not depend on the scale
%   of parameters because the range of every parameter is rescaled to [0 1] in PSP.
%   Even so, IniJump is problem-dependent and should affect the efficiency of PSP.
%   The default value is 0.1.
%
%   SmpSize - Sizes of MCMC samples used to adapt the Markov chain of each
%   discovered region. The adaptation is performed in two stages each of which
%   consists of a few sampling cycles. SmpSize specifies the size of MCMC sample
%   in one cycle. SmpSize is a row vector of two integers, e.g., [SMPSZ1 SMPSZ2],
%   where SMPSZ1 defines the size of one cycle in the Level 1 stage, and SMPSZ2 in
%   the Level 2 stage. The former must be smaller than the latter (e.g., SMPSZ1 is
%   half of SMPSZ2) since the Level 1 adaptation is designed to be fast but coarse-
%   grained whereas the Level 2 adaptation to be slow but fine-grained. SMPSZ2
%   also serves as the size of regular MCMC cycles following the adaptation, that
%   are counted to determine the termination of PSP (see MaxPSP above). The default
%   setting in PSP is CEIL([100 200]*1.2^NDIM).
%
%   VolEst - Method of volume estimation of dicovered regions. 'Ellipsoid'
%   (default) estimates the volume through ellipsoid approximation using eigen
%   decomposition of the estimated covariance matrix from each region's MCMC
%   sample. Although this method does not require additional computing time, it
%   causes a bias toward overestimation because an ellipsoid fills up the, if any,
%   concavity of the region. 'HitMiss' uses a method inspired by the hit-or-miss
%   Monte Carlo integration, which corrects the bias due to ellipsoid
%   approximation. This method is the same as the regular hit-or-miss method
%   except that the estimated ellipsoid is employed as a base sampling domain,
%   which may exclude some portion of the region and may thus result in
%   underestimation. This method, however, will give better estimates in general.
%   Additional computing time is required after the completion of search process.
%
%   VolSmpSize - Size of a sample used to estimate a region's volume when VolEst
%   is set as 'HitMiss.' Default is CEIL(500*1.2^NDIM).
%
%   Display - Level of display. 'off' displays no output; 'final' displays just the
%   final output (number of patterns found & elapsed time); 'min' displays the
%   region index each time a new data pattern is discovered; 'all' (DEFAULT)
%   displays all the information regarding the status of search and MCMC adaptation.
%
%   DispInterval - Length of intervals (in search trials) at which PSP displays
%   elapsed time while no new pattern is found. By DEFAULT, PSP does so every
%   30,000 search trials.
